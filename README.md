# admin-dashboard

I was working this admin-dashboard webpage today, and I learned:

1. Working with grid and flex at the same time.
2. placing the grid cells in to grid -lines
3. inserting icon on webpage titles

what I need to improve:
1. using minmax() and fractions
2. using clamp for responsive fonts
3. using more of custom properties

it was challenging in the beginning but it become more comfortable working with grid.

Thank you
